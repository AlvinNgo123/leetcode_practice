Write a function, where given a string "s" and a string "t", check if "s" is a subsequnce of "t".
A subsequence of a string is a string which is formed from the original sting by deleting some of the chars w/o disturbing the relative positions of the remaining chars.
This means that it also is possible to delete no chars ("dog" is substring of "dog").
