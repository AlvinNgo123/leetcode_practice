Write a function, where given an input array (arr). determines if the array is monotonic.
Think of a monotonic array as entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.
Non-increasing doesn't necessarily mean only decreasing but just that they don't increase (& vice versa for non-decreasing).
For this situation, we can assume empty and 1 element arrays to be monotonic.
