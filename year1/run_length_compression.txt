Write a function, given a non-empty string , that returns a compressed version of that string by encoding its consecutive, identical characters.
An example compression of "BBBBB" would be "5B".
However, the character can be any symbol including numbers.
Therefore, any consecutive sequence that exceeds 9 must be broken up into smaller chunks.
An example would mean that "CCCCCCCCCCC" would compress to "9C2C".
