Write a function that, given a list of red-shirt student heights and blue-shirt student heights, returns whether it's possible for a class photo to be taken.

A possible class photo has 3 requirements:
1) Only 2 rows of students and all students in front row must be strictly shorter than students in back row
2) All students in red must be in same row
3) All students in blue must be in same row

For this problem, you can assume that there is at least 2 students in the class and there's always an equal number of red and blue shirt students.
