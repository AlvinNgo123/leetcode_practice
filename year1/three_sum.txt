Write a function, where given an array "nums" of n integers, it is able to return all unique triplets (in list form) that sums to zero.
This means that the triplets a + b + c = 0 and the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets. 
The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order.
If no triplet sums to 0, return an empty error.
