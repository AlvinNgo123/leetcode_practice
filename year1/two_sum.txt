Write a function where given an array of integers "nums" and an integer "target", return the two numbers in the array that sum to the target value.
The return array can have the two values in any order but they must be two different integers in the array, meaning you cannot add an integer to itself.
For this problem, you can assume that there is at most one pair and if there are no pairs, just return an empty array.
