Write a function that can compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up a certain amount.
You are given coins of difference denominations in a list (coins) and a total amount of money (amt).
For this situation, you can assume that you have an infinite number of coins and if that amt cannot be made up of any combindation, just return -1.
