Write a function that, given an non-empty array of integers with length "n" where the values range from 1 to n (inclusive), returns the first duplicate value.
For this problem, the first duplicate is the first number that appears twice when reading from left to right.
It's also possible for more than one number to appear twice but we want to only get the first one that appears twice.
If none appear twice, return -1.
