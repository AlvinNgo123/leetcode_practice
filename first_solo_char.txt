Write a function that, given a non-empty string of characters, returns the index of the first character is not repeated (solo) in the rest of the string.
For this problem, there can be multiple characters that don't repeat but you only want the one that appears first (starting from the left).
You can also assume that there will always be at least 1 solo char.
